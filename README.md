# JS-Weather-Manager   

Working with an external API in JavaScript.

This project was to connect to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve data about the current weather conditions for a particular city, as well as the overall forecast for the next 5 days. This was then displayed on a webpage using Vanilla JS and Node.js.

Core Tasks  
- [x] Get London's weather to display on a website using Open Weather Map https://openweathermap.org/api  
- [x] Show London's 5 day forecast on the page  
- [x] Abstract away API call logic into it's own class  
- [x] Stub out API calls in tests (Jest will help you here - https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-async)  
- [x] Deploy to Heroku  

Stretch Goals  
- Select a city from a list, and display the weather for it  
- Have a user type in a city, and display the weather for it  
- [x] Make it look pretty  

Once pulled, run `npm install` and monitor porject using `npm run watch`. To run tests, use `npm test` which runs tests using JEST.
